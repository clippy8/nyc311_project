## Research Question

**How does the complaint behavior of New Yorkers change over the course of a year â€“ using 'HEAT/HOT WATER' and 'NOISE' as examples?**

---

## Motivation & Objectives

The aim of this analysis was to identify typical **seasonal patterns** in citizen complaint behavior in Manhattan, focusing specifically on two frequently reported categories:

- **HEAT/HOT WATER**: strongly influenced by seasonal conditions  
- **NOISE**: potentially year-round, but possibly with fluctuations (e.g., events, weather)

---

## Why is this relevant?

- The NYC 311 dataset is a publicly accessible source that can be used to analyze aspects of **urban life and social tension**.
- Complaints related to heating issues or noise disturbances often affect **socially disadvantaged communities**.
- Seasonal analysis enables **city administrations, social services, or NGOs** to develop more targeted responses and interventions.

---

## Context in the Literature

Previous analyses such as:

- **RentHop** (2021, 2022): documented winter peaks in heating-related complaints  
- **Analytics Vidhya** (2023): examined NYC noise trends, generally constant with mild summer increases

These studies served as **methodological and thematic references** for this project.

## Objective of This Work

- **Provide insight** into how seasonal conditions influence complaint patterns  
- **Methodologically transparent analysis** using open data and reproducibility principles  
- Lay the groundwork for more advanced analyses, e.g., integrating weather or demographic data
