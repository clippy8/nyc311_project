## Overview

The analysis reveals clear differences in the seasonal complaint behavior in Manhattan — both in terms of complaint type and temporal distribution.

---

## HEAT/HOT WATER

- **Distinct seasonal pattern** with **strong peaks in winter** (especially January and February)
- **Almost no complaints during summer months**
- → This corresponds with **NYC’s legal heating requirements**: landlords are required to provide heat between October and May
- **Social relevance**: Complaints are concentrated in **lower-income neighborhoods** (e.g., the Bronx, Harlem – according to RentHop)
- ➤ **Validated by external studies:**
  - RentHop (2021, 2022)
  - Schwarzwald_AI (Medium, 2021)

**Conclusion:**  
HEAT-related complaints are **strongly seasonal** and highlight clear infrastructural deficiencies in the housing sector.

## NOISE_TOTAL

- **Consistently high levels throughout the year**: approx. 6,000–8,000 complaints per month
- **Slight increases in summer** → possibly due to outdoor events, open windows, increased social activity
- NOISE is **not seasonally driven**, but rather **a structural urban issue**
- ➤ **Validated by:**
  - Analytics Vidhya (2023)
  - NY Post (2025): “Noise” was the most reported complaint type with >738,000 cases

**Conclusion:**  
NOISE complaints reflect **persistent issues in urban quality of life**. They span multiple aspects (traffic, nightlife, neighborhood conflicts) and remain **continuously relevant for urban planning and policy**.

## Comparison of the Two Categories

| Aspect                | HEAT/HOT WATER                     | NOISE_TOTAL                            |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Seasonality           | High (winter-driven)               | Low to moderate (peaks in summer)      |
| Causes                | Legal, social, infrastructure       | Social, urban, cultural                |
| Literature Reference  | RentHop, Schwarzwald_AI             | Analytics Vidhya, NY Post              |
| Policy Implications   | Housing and social policy           | Noise regulation, public order         |

## Ideas for Expansion

- Breakdown of **noise subcategories** (e.g., “Noise - Park”, “Noise - Vehicle”)  
- Integration with **weather data** (temperature, precipitation)  
- Comparison with other boroughs (e.g., Bronx vs. Manhattan)

---

## Conclusion

The results confirm key findings from the literature:
- *HEAT complaints are clearly temperature- and regulation-dependent*
- *NOISE complaints are persistent and deeply embedded in social dynamics*

This analysis **confirms those patterns** based on current data (2023–2025) and provides a solid foundation for further exploratory or statistical studies.
